# Clipjump Addons

Repo for all the Clipjump plugins and customs (customizations).  
Please feel free to contribute and add your own.  
You can add a wiki page for your plugin/custom too.
  

## Installation
  
It is recommended that you download the entire repo before preceeding to install.
  

#### Plugins
1. Copy desired plugins to the `plugins` directory of Clipjump. Remember that the sorting folders (external, pformat) used here is only for categorizing purposes. You will need to have all plugins in the root folder itself.
2. Then copy the `lib_extras` folder you downloaded from this repo and put it in the Clipjump root folder such that `Clipjump.exe` and `lib_extras` are parallel. Replace files if needed.
